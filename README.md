# Benson Karki ⚡

**Programming Kid (High School Senior)'**

I’m @bensonkarki or Benson, a 17 y/o senior at Clovis North High School. Right now I’m interested in web development, crypto, artificial intelligence, programming, youtube, streaming, and basketball. I’m currently learning JavaScript for web development and have experience with Java, HTML, and CSS. In the future I want to work with blockchain or artificial intelligence technologies. If you're seeing this from my college application, hello!!
