# Benson Karki 🌩

**`Programming Kid (High School Senior)`**

I’m @bensonkarki or Benson, a 17 y/o senior at Clovis North High School. I’m currently learning JavaScript for web development and have experience with Java, HTML, and CSS. I have built some websites you can check out below, and will work upload more projects over time. In the future I want to work with blockchain or artificial intelligence technologies. If you're seeing this from my college application, hello!!
